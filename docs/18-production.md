# Running in production

You've reached the end of the book with a working PDS. It signs commits,
stores records, serves them, issues sessions, accepts uploads. Locally,
it runs entirely in one process — PGlite, the filesystem blob store,
synthetic local-only PLC operations, no external services to deploy.

This chapter is about going from there to a self-hosted PDS that other
people can actually use. The protocol part is portable; the *operations*
part is where you make production-vs-development choices deliberately.

## What changes when you turn the deployment knob

A handful of dev-mode shortcuts that worked great for learning have to be
swapped for production equivalents:

| Subsystem | Dev shortcut | Production swap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | PGlite (WASM) | Hosted Postgres (Neon, Supabase, RDS, Crunchy, self-managed) |
| PLC | Local-only synthetic DIDs | Real plc.directory (or a self-hosted PLC mirror) |
| Blob storage | Filesystem in `./.blobs/` | S3-compatible object storage |
| TLS | None (HTTP on :3000) | Terminating proxy or cloud LB |
| Handle wildcards | `alice.test` | `*.<your-domain>` with DNS + TLS cert |
| Signing keys | Plaintext hex in `accounts.signing_key_priv` | KMS-wrapped or age-encrypted |
| Email | Logged to console | Transactional provider |
| Backups | None | `pnpm pds:export` on a schedule, ch. 23 |
| Observability | `console.log` | Structured logs, metrics, alerts |

We'll take each in turn.

## Postgres

Pick one. The PDS doesn't care about the provider — anything that speaks
the Postgres wire protocol and supports `BYTEA`, `bigserial`, and `JSON`
columns works.

Sizing rules of thumb:

- **Connection limits.** The PDS uses up to 10 concurrent connections per
  process by default (see `postgres-js` config in `src/lib/db/index.ts`).
  Multiply by your process count. Most managed Postgres providers cap
  connections far below what direct connections need at scale — use a
  pooler (PgBouncer in transaction mode, or Neon's built-in pooler) and
  reduce the per-process pool size accordingly.
- **Storage.** Repo blocks dominate. A Bluesky-shaped active account is
  ~500 KB of MST + ~1–5 MB of post records over a year. Plan ~10 MB per
  active account per year as a conservative starting point.
- **WAL retention.** Keep the WAL window wide enough that you can rebuild
  a replica from a base backup + WAL replay if Postgres goes down.

Migrations:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... pnpm db:migrate
```

The same `drizzle/*.sql` files run against PGlite in dev and your hosted
Postgres in prod. The `__migrations` journal table tracks applied files
so re-running is safe.

> ⚠️ **Don't expose `pgvector` or other extensions** unless you've audited
> them. PDS doesn't use them, so install nothing you don't understand.

## TLS

The AT Protocol does not work over plain HTTP for production. Every
client expects HTTPS. Three reasonable setups:

1. **Cloud load balancer.** AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancing, Cloudflare
   in front of the PDS — terminates TLS, forwards HTTP to the PDS over a
   private network. Simplest at scale.
2. **Caddy or nginx in front.** A single VM running Caddy with automatic
   Let's Encrypt is the smallest-setup option. The PDS listens on
   `127.0.0.1:3000`; Caddy listens on `:443`.
3. **Direct from the app.** Possible (Bun and Deno make TLS-from-the-app
   easy; Node needs more config) but you give up the operational
   ergonomics of a separate proxy.

Whichever you pick: ensure the public URL the PDS knows about
(`PDS_PUBLIC_URL`) matches what clients connect to, including the protocol.

## Handle wildcards

If your PDS issues handles like `alice.yourdomain.com`, the resolver step
(`https://alice.yourdomain.com/.well-known/atproto-did`) needs to reach
the PDS. Two options:

1. **Wildcard DNS + wildcard TLS.** Point `*.yourdomain.com` at the PDS's
   IP, issue a wildcard certificate (Let's Encrypt supports it via DNS-01
   challenges). The PDS reads the `Host` header to figure out which
   handle is being asked about and responds.
2. **`_atproto` DNS TXT records.** For users who own their own domain,
   skip the wildcard entirely and let them publish
   `_atproto.theirdomain.com TXT "did=did:plc:..."`. The PDS doesn't need
   to be reachable on `theirdomain.com`. This is how high-end accounts
   typically work (`pfrazee.com`, `bsky.app` itself, etc.).

For the teaching port we punt on serving handles under our own domain:
dev handles use the `.test` TLD which won't DNS-resolve. But we do
implement **resolution of *other* people's handles** —
`com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` falls through to
`src/pds/did/handle_resolver.ts`, which races a `_atproto.<handle>` DNS
TXT lookup and a `https://<handle>/.well-known/atproto-did` HTTPS fetch,
then does the bidirectional check against the resolved DID document's
`alsoKnownAs`. That means clients can ask this PDS to resolve any
handle on the network, not just the ones it hosts.

## PLC: directory or self-hosted

The PDS in dev mode runs `PDS_LOCAL_PLC=true` and never talks to
plc.directory. To federate, you have to flip that:

```bash
PDS_LOCAL_PLC=false
```

The handful of places that need wiring, all of which now ship:

1. **Genesis publishing.** `src/pds/account/create.ts` (the fresh-account
   branch) calls `publishPlcOp` between `persistGenesisPlc` and the
   firehose emit. The op was signed earlier; we POST the JSON form of
   the *signed* op to `https://plc.directory/<did>`. The DID is the same
   hash either way (it's derived from the op's bytes), so existing local
   DIDs *can* be uploaded after the fact by re-publishing — but it's
   awkward; flip the flag *before* you create accounts you want
   federated. Migrating-in accounts deliberately skip publishing — the
   user's previous PDS already registered the DID, and the rotate op
   they brought authorises the swap.
2. **Handle-rotation publishing.** `rotatePlc` in `src/pds/did/plc.ts`
   calls `publishPlcOp` after appending the new op locally. plc.directory
   ingests the whole chain at the same `/<did>` endpoint.
3. **External DID resolution.** `src/pds/did/external_resolver.ts`
   exposes `resolveDid(did)` — it tries the local `accounts` table first
   (own DIDs short-circuit, no network call), then falls back to
   `https://plc.directory/<did>` for did:plc and
   `https://<host>/.well-known/did.json` for did:web. Results cache
   in-process for 5 minutes; misses negative-cache for 30 seconds so a
   flood of bad requests doesn't hammer the directory. Most XRPC
   handlers still call `resolveLocalDid` because they're only ever
   resolving their own accounts — cross-PDS resolution lands when the
   sync endpoints need it.
4. **Account migration** (chapter 20) needs the same rotation-key path
   to work end-to-end against plc.directory. If you stayed in local-PLC
   mode while testing migration, the rotation keys exist but nobody else
   can verify them.

> ⚠️ **Publishing is best-effort with one retry.** `publishPlcOp` retries
> once on network errors / 5xx with a 250 ms backoff, treats 409 as
> idempotent success, and surfaces 400 as a hard failure. For
> high-volume production, wrap account creation in a job queue so a
> directory outage doesn't break signups — the signed op is already
> durable in `plc_operations`, so a background worker can replay
> unpublished ops by re-decoding the bytes.

> 📖 **Running your own PLC mirror** is a serious commitment — the
> directory's job is to be a globally trusted append-only log, which
> means hosting all DID operations forever and serving them with high
> availability. Most self-hosters use plc.directory and trust Bluesky to
> run it. If you want independence, mirror the directory's data locally
> and serve from there; coordinate with the broader ecosystem.

## Blob storage

`BLOB_STORE=s3` (when implemented) plus standard AWS env vars and a
bucket name. The bucket layout in `src/pds/blob/store.ts` is:

```
<bucket>/<creator-did>/<cid>.bin
```

Bucket configuration:

- **Lifecycle policy** to delete keys older than 30 days that don't have a
  matching reference in `record_blobs` (run the PDS's GC alongside this
  as a belt-and-suspenders approach).
- **CORS** allowing GETs from your AppView origins, if you let clients
  fetch blobs directly from the bucket (not the default — `getBlob` is
  PDS-mediated).
- **Versioning** off (we don't overwrite blobs; content addressing makes
  versions meaningless).
- **Encryption at rest** on (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS — both transparent to
  the PDS).

## Signing keys

`accounts.signing_key_priv` and `accounts.rotation_key_priv` are hex
strings in plain Postgres rows. In production:

- **KMS-wrap.** Encrypt the private scalar at write time using a KMS key
  (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault). Store the ciphertext in
  the column. Decrypt on demand when signing. The KMS audit log gives
  you a record of every signature attempt.
- **age-encrypted column.** Lighter weight: a single age recipient holds
  the unwrap key, decrypts on PDS startup, keeps the plaintext keys in
  process memory. Simpler than KMS, but loses the per-signature audit
  trail.

The teaching port's signing keys are deliberately readable so you can
inspect them, run `verifyCommit` by hand, etc. Don't ship that bit.

## The firehose connection budget

When the WebSocket firehose lands (a later session), every connected
consumer is a long-running socket. Each holds onto:

- A cursor (a single integer).
- A bounded outgoing buffer (we'll cap it at ~10 MB to bound memory).
- A goroutine-equivalent in the Node event loop.

Modern Node handles ~10k concurrent WebSockets per process without
sweating. Beyond that, scale horizontally — every consumer pulls from
the same `repo_seq` table, so multiple PDS processes can each serve
firehose subscribers independently. The `LISTEN/NOTIFY` channel coalesces
new-event notifications cheaply.

A reasonable production limit: 1000 concurrent firehose consumers per
process; alarm at 800; cap subscriber count or scale out at 1000.

## Backups

Two things need to survive a complete loss of disk: the Postgres rows
and the blob bytes. The PDS ships two scripts for this — `pnpm pds:export`
dumps both into a portable directory, `pnpm pds:import` restores from
one. [Chapter 23](./23-backups.md) walks the format, the safety rails
(schema-hash gate, empty-target gate), the topological FK order the
import follows, and a suggested production cadence.

Pair the export with whatever your Postgres provider gives you (PITR,
WAL archive, point-in-time snapshots). The script is for portability
and disaster recovery; provider-native backups are for the
fifteen-minute-RPO case. Both are cheap; running them in parallel is
the cheapest insurance you'll buy this year.

## Observability

Three categories worth instrumenting:

**Logs**: structured JSON, one line per request, including the NSID, the
account DID, the response status, the duration. Skip the request body
unless you're debugging — it might contain blob bytes.

**Metrics**: at minimum,

- request count + duration histogram, labeled by NSID and status code
- DB pool wait time
- blob upload bytes
- firehose connection count
- `repo_seq` lag (now() − latest sequencedAt) — should always be sub-second

**Alerts**: page on

- 5xx rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- DB pool saturation > 80% for 5 minutes
- disk space < 20%
- firehose lag > 10 seconds (means consumers are getting stale data)
- backup failure

## Benchmarking + load testing

Two scripts ship for sanity-checking performance, both running against the
same orchestrators the XRPC handlers wrap — no HTTP, no JSON parsing, no
auth middleware. They measure the work itself, not the dispatcher.

**`pnpm bench`** is a microbenchmark over four hot paths: `createAccount`,
`applyWrites` (single record), `listRecords` (one 50-row page), and
`getRepo` (full CAR export). Each runs N times (default 100) and the
script prints median, p99, min, and max in milliseconds. Use it
**before/after a perf-sensitive PR** — if you touched the MST, the commit
signer, or the records index, run it locally on `main` first, then on
your branch, and compare. Roll a fresh baseline at every release tag so
regressions are visible against a stable reference rather than against
whatever was on `main` last week.

**`pnpm stress`** drives N accounts × M posts (defaults: 100 × 10)
sequentially through `createAccount` + `applyWrites`. It prints total
elapsed, account- and post-creates per second, and the on-disk DB size
(via `pg_database_size(current_database())`, falling back to a recursive
directory stat). Use it for **capacity planning**: it surfaces
sequence-table back-pressure, MST node bloat, blockstore write
amplification, and — once you point it at a real Postgres via
`DATABASE_URL` — connection pool starvation and the difference between
the in-process driver path and one that goes over a socket.

What neither tells you: anything about a real deployment. Production
adds network round-trips between the client and the PDS, real disk
latency (the bench's tmpfs is unrepresentative), real concurrency
(neither script forks; the PDS itself serialises writes per repo today),
real auth contention (every request goes through password verify on the
first hit, JWT verify thereafter), and real plc.directory latency
(both scripts force `PDS_LOCAL_PLC=true`).

Both default to PGlite. For numbers that reflect what your operator
hardware will do, set `DATABASE_URL` to a hosted Postgres and re-run:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... pnpm bench --iterations 200
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... pnpm stress --accounts 1000 --posts-per-account 50
```

If the hosted Postgres run is *slower* than PGlite for tiny benches,
that's expected — the network round-trip per query swamps the work. The
gap inverts at scale, where Postgres's buffer cache and parallelism
matter and PGlite's single-threaded WASM ceiling is the bottleneck.

## Email

`createAccount` currently doesn't send a verification email. Production
should require it. Two reasonable approaches:

1. **Transactional provider** (Postmark, SendGrid, Resend) — POST a
   templated email at signup, store the verification token in a
   `email_tokens` table, expose `com.atproto.server.confirmEmail`.
2. **AWS SES + a simple template.** Cheaper at scale, more setup.

Either way: don't send the verification email synchronously from
`createAccount`'s critical path. Queue it (or fire-and-forget with
retries) so a slow email provider doesn't make signup feel slow.

## The deploy itself

A representative production layout:

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│   Caddy (TLS + handle)     │
│   :443                     │
└─────────────┬──────────────┘
              │
   ┌──────────▼──────────┐
   │   PDS (Node)        │
   │   :3000 internal    │
   │   N processes       │
   └─┬──────────┬──────┬─┘
     │          │      │
     ▼          ▼      ▼
  Postgres   S3-      plc.directory
             bucket
```

Three external dependencies (Postgres, S3, plc.directory) plus the
fronting proxy. The PDS itself is stateless — kill any process at any
time, all state survives in the dependencies.

For zero-downtime deploys: rolling restart, draining each process for
~30 seconds (long enough for in-flight requests to complete; the
firehose drops to other processes on disconnect).

## A short pre-launch checklist

- [ ] `pnpm db:migrate` ran against prod Postgres
- [ ] `PDS_JWT_SECRET` is unique and stored in your secret manager, not
      in git
- [ ] `PDS_PUBLIC_URL` matches the public hostname exactly
- [ ] `PDS_LOCAL_PLC=false`
- [ ] Signing-key encryption is in place (KMS or age)
- [ ] TLS cert is issued and renewing
- [ ] `https://<host>/.well-known/did.json` returns the service DID doc
- [ ] `curl -sI https://<host>/xrpc/com.atproto.server.describeServer`
      returns 200
- [ ] Postgres backups configured (`pnpm pds:export` cron + provider
      WAL archive; see [chapter 23](./23-backups.md)) and quarterly
      restore drill on the calendar
- [ ] S3 lifecycle + replication configured
- [ ] Logs + metrics + alerts flowing
- [ ] An email-verification flow exists (even if minimal)

When that's all green, register your first account, sign in from a
Bluesky-compatible client, and watch the bytes flow.

## Where to go from here

The teaching book ends here, but the protocol keeps moving. A few threads
this implementation deliberately left untouched:

- **OAuth.** The protocol is migrating from password-based sessions to a
  full OAuth flow. The shape is in
  [the OAuth spec](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth);
  [chapter 21](./21-oauth.md) implements the back half (metadata, JWKS,
  token endpoint, revocation, DPoP). The browser-facing pieces
  (`/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/par`, consent UI, client metadata
  validation, PKCE) are deferred to a follow-on session, with stubs in
  place and gaps flagged in the chapter itself.
- **Account migration.** The cross-PDS handoff that lets a user pick up
  their DID and repo and move hosts. Implemented in
  [chapter 20](./20-migration.md) — the four new endpoints, the schema
  changes, and the gaps still open (notably `createAccount` accepting a
  pre-existing DID).
- **App passwords.** Headless clients (CLIs, bots, archival scripts)
  authenticate with credentials separate from the main password, with
  scope restrictions. The schema column exists; the flow doesn't yet.
- **Moderation.** Takedowns, label propagation, the moderation log.
  Label-and-hide rules are an AppView concern, but the operator-facing
  surface for managing accounts on *your* PDS — takedowns, force-renames,
  out-of-band emails, deletions — lives in
  [chapter 19](./19-moderation.md).

The codebase is small enough that any of these is a tractable addition.
Skim, pick one, and add it.
